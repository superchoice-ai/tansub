# CRITICAL RULE — Mandatory Full-Project Impact Review

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a critical, non-optional governance rule for every human and AI contributor. It applies before any development or repository change, regardless of size.

## Absolute requirement

Before changing anything—including wording, labels, comments, documentation, configuration, dependencies, schemas, migrations, environment variables, proxies, API clients, UI, workflows, permissions, or a single line of code—you MUST:

1. Inspect the entire project context relevant to the proposed change, not only the target file.
2. Trace all upstream and downstream dependencies, integrations, shared clients, proxies, environment bindings, database objects, workflows, roles, and consumers that may be affected.
3. Perform and record a full-project impact review before implementation.
4. Identify existing behavior that must remain unchanged and define regression risks.
5. Define validation, regression tests, rollback, and evidence required for acceptance.
6. Stop and request explicit confirmation when impact, ownership, production topology, credentials, data migration, or rollback safety is unclear.
7. Implement only the reviewed and approved scope.
8. After implementation, run the defined validation and regression tests and report the evidence.

## No small-change exemption

There is no exemption for a “small,” “safe,” “cosmetic,” “wording-only,” or “obvious” change. A minor edit can alter routing, shared components, generated artifacts, database behavior, integrations, or operational workflows. Assumptions are not evidence.

## Fail-closed rule

If the impact review is missing, incomplete, or cannot prove that dependent behavior is protected, DO NOT DEV, DO NOT MERGE, DO NOT DEPLOY, and DO NOT modify production data.

## Minimum impact-review record

The review must state:

- requested change and exact scope;
- affected repository, files, modules, database objects, APIs, proxies, workflows, roles, and environments;
- dependency and consumer trace;
- security, data-integrity, permission, operational, and compatibility risks;
- regression-test plan and expected results;
- rollback plan;
- unresolved questions and approval gate;
- post-change evidence.

The Supabase proxy/approval-workflow regression is the standing lesson: changing shared infrastructure without tracing every consumer can silently break previously working approval behavior and force costly regression recovery. This must not happen again.


# CRITICAL RULE — Interpretation Confirmation Before Reasoning or Action

> [!CAUTION]
> Repository artifacts are evidence of what exists; they are not automatic authorization, approved requirements, or permission to design or implement anything.

## Mandatory interpretation gate

Whenever a human or AI encounters anything that requires interpretation—including an enum value, schema object, migration, route, workflow name, roadmap item, TODO, comment, label, mockup, dormant code, “future” feature, existing partial implementation, or ambiguous user wording—it MUST NOT decide the intended business meaning by itself.

Before treating that interpretation as a requirement, deriving a solution from it, planning implementation, extending an impact review on that basis, or changing anything, it MUST:

1. State exactly what artifact or wording was found.
2. State the proposed interpretation in plain language.
3. Compare it against confirmed business rules, invariants, previous decisions, current scope, and explicit exclusions.
4. Identify every conflict, ambiguity, assumption, and alternative interpretation.
5. Ask the user/authorized owner to confirm the intended meaning.
6. Wait for explicit confirmation before continuing reasoning that depends on that interpretation or performing any implementation.

Read-only inspection is allowed only to gather enough evidence to expose the ambiguity and ask for confirmation. It does not authorize solution design or implementation.

## Artifacts are not approval

The presence of a name or capability in any repository artifact does not prove that it is:

- an approved feature;
- valid under current business rules;
- in current scope;
- safe to implement;
- intended to be active;
- authorized for production;
- authorized for design or impact expansion.

For example, an enum such as `restructure`, a dormant workflow, or a future roadmap entry MUST remain unsupported/fail-closed unless its business meaning and scope are explicitly confirmed.

## Conflict precedence and stop rule

Confirmed business invariants and explicit user decisions override inferred meaning from code, schema, enums, documentation, naming, or conventional industry practice.

If a proposed interpretation conflicts with a confirmed rule, STOP. Do not “design an exception,” do not assume a future requirement, and do not continue merely because the user said “Continue.” Present the conflict and request a decision.

“Continue” authorizes only the next work that is already confirmed and consistent with existing rules. It never confirms an unstated interpretation and never authorizes the next listed enum, phase, workflow, or roadmap item automatically.

## No interpretation-by-convention

Do not infer intent from best practices, common product behavior, technical possibility, industry terminology, or what a field/workflow normally means. Recommendations may be offered only after the actual business meaning is confirmed, and they must be clearly separated from confirmed requirements.

## Fail-closed requirement

If confirmation is missing, unclear, contradictory, or not attributable to an authorized decision maker:

- keep the feature unsupported or disabled;
- keep workflow dispatch fail-closed;
- do not modify code, schema, data, documentation conclusions, or production behavior based on the interpretation;
- record the unresolved question and wait.

## Required evidence record

The confirmation record must include:

- artifact or wording that triggered interpretation;
- proposed interpretation;
- conflicts checked;
- alternatives considered;
- explicit confirmed meaning;
- confirmer/decision owner;
- scope authorized;
- items explicitly not authorized.

## Standing lessons

The Supabase Proxy regression showed the danger of technical change without full dependency impact review. The `restructure` misunderstanding showed that even a detailed impact review is unsafe when it begins from an unconfirmed business interpretation. Both gates are mandatory: first confirm meaning, then perform full-project impact review.


# CRITICAL RULE — System Readiness Gate

> [!CAUTION]
> This gate is mandatory before every actionable work session, continuation, development task, migration, deployment, workflow activation, external write, or production/data operation. A green status page alone is not proof that the project's actual path is healthy.

## Required readiness header

Before reasoning toward implementation or taking action, state and record:

- conversation/task scope and explicit exclusions;
- repository, branch, phase/change set, and target environment (local/demo/staging/production);
- exact systems and dependency path that the task will touch;
- operations authorized now and operations that remain unauthorized;
- official provider status checked, timestamp, timezone, and relevant component/region;
- read-only smoke-test evidence for the actual project path;
- final decision: `GO`, `LIMITED GO`, or `NO-GO`.

Repeat the gate whenever scope changes, the environment changes, a new dependency is introduced, an incident begins, or more than 15 minutes have passed before a high-risk write.

## Two-layer readiness check

1. **Provider status:** Check every relevant provider's official status page. Never use an unofficial outage detector as acceptance evidence.
2. **Project-path probe:** Run the smallest safe read-only check through the same route that the work will use. Examples include repository read, `SELECT now()`, a non-mutating API health request, webhook dry-run, or dependency-specific connectivity check.

If a provider has no verified public status page, record `UNKNOWN — no verified public status page` and require a direct read-only probe. Do not silently substitute a third-party status site.

## Fail-closed and degraded-mode rules

- `NO-GO`: Do not migrate, deploy, activate, merge, change production data, or perform external writes when a relevant dependency is degraded, unknown without a successful probe, returning timeouts/5xx, or inconsistent with the expected environment.
- `LIMITED GO`: Read-only inspection, local analysis, documentation, and isolated GitHub work may continue only when they do not depend on or write through the degraded path.
- A timeout from Lovable Database Query Gateway/MCP does not by itself prove that the database is damaged or that a migration caused a lock. Correlate official incidents, direct database health, query-path behavior, logs, locks, and migration evidence before assigning root cause.
- Never bypass approval, permission, audit, regression, or data-integrity controls to work around an unavailable provider.

## Alternate-path and synchronization rule

Work may be moved to another healthy system—such as preparing code or documentation in GitHub—only when the alternate path is explicitly within scope and does not require the unhealthy dependency. Before reflecting changes back into Lovable or another target system:

1. re-run this readiness gate for the target path;
2. confirm branch/environment alignment and inspect the complete diff;
3. perform the mandatory impact review and interpretation confirmation;
4. use the normal supported synchronization path;
5. run regression tests after synchronization.

Do not force-push, rewrite published history, manually patch generated state, or treat GitHub completion as proof that Lovable, Supabase, n8n, or production has applied the change.

## Official status registry

This registry is the minimum known project dependency set. Add any dependency discovered by the task before work begins.

| System | Official status URL | Relevant scope |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | https://www.githubstatus.com/ | Git operations, API and repository sync |
| Lovable | https://status.lovable.dev/ | Editor, Cloud, MCP and API |
| Supabase | https://status.supabase.com/ | Database, API Gateway, Auth, Edge Functions and Management API |

# CRITICAL RULE — Explicit Authorization, Literal Read Scope, and Verified Capability

> [!CAUTION]
> This lesson-learned rule is mandatory for every human and AI contributor. It prevents unauthorized development, scope expansion, and premature claims that a task or repository is inaccessible.

## 1. No workflow or node creation without explicit authorization

Do not create, modify, run, activate, publish, import, or delete any workflow or node unless the authorized owner has explicitly approved that exact action and scope.

Creating a workflow or node is development. It is not read-only preparation, exploration, inspection, or documentation work. A request to inspect, study, copy, or summarize repository documentation does not authorize workflow or node creation.

If the available environment can perform the requested write only by creating or changing a workflow, stop and request explicit authorization before creating or changing it. Tool limitations do not broaden authority.

## 2. Interpret instructions literally and confirm before expanding scope

Follow the repository's Interpretation Confirmation Gate without exception.

Unless the authorized owner explicitly says otherwise:

- “read/study the .MD” means read the existing Markdown files only;
- “copy the .MD” means retrieve/read the Markdown content for reference only;
- neither phrase authorizes editing, committing, pushing, opening a pull request, creating automation, changing a workflow/node, or starting development;
- “before development” includes every preparatory action that mutates an external system, repository, workflow, node, database, deployment, credential, or runtime state.

When wording could support more than one meaning, state the possible interpretations and wait for confirmation. Do not choose the broader interpretation yourself.

## 3. Verify actual access and environment capability before declaring failure

Do not claim that a repository, file, credential, system, or task is inaccessible or impossible until reasonable read-only verification has been completed.

The verification must include, as relevant:

1. authenticated identity and connected account;
2. repository/organization visibility and exact owner/name;
3. branch and path existence, including case and renamed/archived repositories;
4. installed connector, credential, permission, token scope, and available tool capability;
5. direct read-only probe through the intended access path;
6. observed HTTP/status/error evidence and whether the failure is authentication, authorization, path, provider incident, or unsupported capability.

A first 404, 401, timeout, empty search result, missing UI control, or unfamiliar tool is not sufficient evidence that access is impossible. Report what was checked, the evidence found, and what remains unknown. Never expose secrets while verifying.

## Fail-closed enforcement

If explicit authorization, intended meaning, or verified capability is unclear:

- perform only the minimum read-only inspection needed to explain the ambiguity;
- do not create or modify workflows/nodes;
- do not edit, commit, push, merge, deploy, or change data;
- do not invent a workaround that mutates another system;
- present the evidence and wait for the authorized owner's decision.

## Standing lesson

An AI was asked only to read repository Markdown but created exploratory workflows, interpreted “copy .MD” as permission to commit and develop, and initially reported repositories as unavailable after a superficial 404 despite an authorized GitHub credential being available. These were scope-control and verification failures. This rule exists to prevent recurrence.

# CRITICAL RULE — Cloud Browser Continuity Assessment

> [!CAUTION]
> When normal development is blocked by an external provider or a failing tool path outside the project's control, do not default to waiting indefinitely. After checking official documentation and official service status, present Cloud Browser as a temporary continuity option only when a read-only feasibility assessment proves that it can safely continue the exact authorized work.

## Mandatory order

1. Check the current official documentation for the affected feature, API, limitation, authentication method, and supported recovery path.
2. Check the official provider status page and incident history; record the timestamp, timezone, affected component/region, and incident link.
3. Run the smallest safe read-only probe through the normal project path and preserve the exact error evidence.
4. Identify whether the failure is provider-wide, account/project-specific, permission-related, configuration-related, or limited to a gateway/tool path.
5. If the normal path remains blocked, explicitly propose a Cloud Browser feasibility assessment and obtain authorization before opening or using the signed-in browser session.
6. Use Cloud Browser read-only first to verify the exact project and environment, authenticated identity, available data/schema/logs/admin surfaces, and whether the browser route is genuinely independent of the failing path.
7. Classify the result as `GO`, `LIMITED GO`, or `NO-GO` before any development continues.

## Feasibility decision

- `GO`: The exact required path works, project/environment identity is verified, authorized actions are supported, data-integrity controls remain intact, and validation plus rollback are available.
- `LIMITED GO`: Only explicitly bounded work may continue, such as read-only inspection, evidence collection, SQL preparation, documentation, or another isolated task that does not depend on the failed path.
- `NO-GO`: Stop when authentication or environment identity is uncertain, the browser uses the same failing backend, required permissions or audit controls are missing, writes cannot be made atomic and reversible, or the risk to production/data integrity is unclear.

A page loading successfully is not sufficient evidence. The assessment must prove that the exact operation needed for development can be completed and verified safely.

## Safety and authorization boundaries

- Cloud Browser is a continuity path, not permission to bypass access controls, provider safeguards, approval gates, audit requirements, or repository rules.
- Do not enter, request, expose, or copy credentials or secrets in chat. Use only an existing authorized signed-in session and require manual user takeover when login is needed.
- Read-only inspection may establish feasibility; it does not authorize a write, migration, deployment, merge, workflow activation, or production-data change.
- Before any separately authorized write, require a backup or rollback plan, transaction/dry-run where supported, atomic scope, full impact review, and post-change regression evidence.
- Recheck official status before merge, deployment, synchronization, or production/data operations. Return to the normal supported integration path after recovery.

## Required continuity record

Record:

- task, repository, branch, project, and target environment;
- official documentation and official status URLs checked;
- timestamp and timezone;
- exact normal-path failure and evidence;
- Cloud Browser route tested and proof that it differs from or remains unaffected by the failed path;
- authenticated identity/project verification without exposing secrets;
- actions verified, actions not verified, and explicit exclusions;
- decision: `GO`, `LIMITED GO`, or `NO-GO`;
- rollback, validation, and synchronization plan;
- owner authorization required before the next mutating action.

## Standing example

Supabase status (<https://status.supabase.com/>) and Lovable incident history (<https://status.lovable.dev/history>) are standing examples: an external gateway or platform incident may block normal development for days even when a separately authorized Cloud Browser path can still support bounded work. They are examples, not assumptions. Always verify the current official evidence and prove project-specific feasibility before recommending continuation.


<!-- TEST DATA ISOLATION AND CONTROLLED CLEANUP — BEGIN -->
# CRITICAL RULE — Test Data Isolation, Traceability, Retention, and Controlled Cleanup

> [!CAUTION]
> This rule is mandatory for every manual or automated test in every environment. Existing data must be treated as protected data even when it appears to be old, mock, inactive, duplicated, or convenient for testing.

## Create-only test-data rule

- Tests MUST create new synthetic data. Never edit, reuse, approve, reject, cancel, convert, attach children to, or delete any pre-existing record for test purposes.
- If a test requires “old,” historical, legacy, approved, rejected, cancelled, contracted, paid, or otherwise progressed data, create a new synthetic root and progress that synthetic data through the required states. Do not repurpose existing data.
- Test data must use a unique, documented run identifier or prefix that cannot be confused with business data.

## Mandatory creation manifest and lineage

Before creating test data, record:

- test run ID/prefix, purpose, owner, environment, branch, and creation time;
- every root record created;
- every child, downstream, approval, audit, document, payment, accounting, notification, counter, and workflow record that may be created as a consequence;
- the exact creation order, relationships, table/entity IDs, and expected cleanup order;
- whether any sequence/counter is intentionally retained to preserve monotonic numbering.

The tester MUST learn and document the full creation path while testing so the cleanup scope is derived from known lineage, not guessed later from broad dates, branches, names, or table scans.

## Retention and deletion approval

- Do NOT delete, reset, anonymize, or clean up test data while testing is active.
- Retain all created test data until the complete test scope has finished and the authorized owner explicitly approves deletion.
- Test completion alone is not deletion authorization. Approval must identify the test run or exact data scope to remove.

## Controlled cleanup

After explicit approval:

1. Resolve the exact cleanup set from the creation manifest and stable IDs.
2. Preserve all pre-existing/shared data, including records temporarily referenced during the test.
3. Delete child/downstream records before roots, preferably in one atomic transaction.
4. Do not use a broad date, branch, status, partial-name, or environment-wide delete condition when stable IDs or an exact test prefix are available.
5. Do not roll counters backward when that could reuse an issued number; document intentional sequence gaps instead.
6. Verify zero remaining test-prefix records, zero target IDs, zero broken references/orphans, unchanged protected data, and valid constraints/indexes.
7. Report exact per-table deletion counts, retained operational state, verification evidence, and anything still UNKNOWN.

If ownership or lineage cannot be proven, STOP and request clarification. Never “clean up what looks like test data.”
<!-- TEST DATA ISOLATION AND CONTROLLED CLEANUP — END -->

<!-- LOVABLE PROD/DEV BRANCH SEPARATION — BEGIN -->
# CRITICAL RULE — Lovable Production and Development Branch Separation

> [!CAUTION]
> This rule applies whenever Lovable is the primary web application/editor or the repository is connected to Lovable.

- GitHub branch `main` is the only branch authorized as the source for Lovable production publishing.
- Production is the published Lovable URL, normally `https://<project>.lovable.app`.
- Do NOT develop, experiment, generate code, or commit feature/fix work directly on `main`. All development MUST occur on a separate non-main development branch.
- Lovable Project Preview UI is the Dev/QA environment and uses an ephemeral preview URL such as `https://[project-id]-preview.lovable.app`.
- Before any test, sync, publish, or release decision, verify the exact GitHub branch connected to Lovable. Lovable UI labels such as “Main” or “Draft” describe Lovable UI/design state and MUST NOT be interpreted as GitHub branch names.
- Preview/non-main code must never be published as production. Publish only after the approved development branch is reviewed, validated, merged into `main`, branch synchronization is confirmed, and the authorized owner explicitly approves production publishing.
- A production hotfix must still be developed on a non-main branch and merged through the approved review path. Do not bypass branch separation because a change is urgent or small.
- If Lovable cannot prove the connected branch or environment, STOP with `NO-GO`; do not develop on `main` and do not publish.

This separation is mandatory because Lovable uses the production published URL and project preview URL as the practical PROD/Dev boundary.
<!-- LOVABLE PROD/DEV BRANCH SEPARATION — END -->

<!-- REUSABLE IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCES — MANDATORY -->
> [!CAUTION]
> For AI Assistant, MCP, external AI integrations, Demo options, or Production ↔ Demo promotion, every human and AI MUST read `DEMO_OPTION_ASSISTANT_REFERENCE.MD` and `DEMO_OPTION_MCP_REFERENCE.MD` before implementation or merge. Raw execution logs must not be committed or copied as implementation. Compare current source against both references and verify diff, schema, Auth/RLS, role/branch scope, build, regression, and rollback.
<!-- REUSABLE IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCES — END -->


<!-- AFTER REMIX BE DB REFERENCE — MANDATORY -->
> [!CAUTION]
> For any Remix, Clone, copied project/repository, Demo separation, Lovable project switch, or Backend/Database switch, every human and AI MUST read `AFTER_REMIX_BE_DB_REFERENCE.MD` before development or Main ↔ Demo comparison. Verify FE/BE project identity, migration target, schema, Auth/RLS, grants, external resources, old/new write evidence, regression, and rollback. Documentation alone is not proof of zero impact.
<!-- AFTER REMIX BE DB REFERENCE — END -->

<!-- SUPERCHOICE AI PLATFORM CROSS-SYSTEM SCOPE GATE — BEGIN -->
# CRITICAL RULE — SuperChoice AI Platform Cross-System Scope and Confirmation Gate

> [!CAUTION]
> SuperChoice AI is an AI Platform with n8n as a central orchestration layer. A change in one integration may affect multiple projects, tenants, subscribers, branches, environments, credentials, webhooks, workflows, or shared services. This gate is mandatory before development or any mutating action.

## 1. Ambiguous target system means STOP

- When a request, discussion, requirement, incident, or code context involves multiple systems and the authorized owner has not explicitly identified the exact system to develop or change, STOP and ask the owner to confirm the target system before development or any mutating action.
- Never select the target system by inference, technical convenience, repository context, architecture convention, prior work, or likelihood.
- Mentioning or discussing a system is not authorization to develop or change that system.
- A general instruction such as “continue,” “fix it,” “make it work,” or “do this” does not resolve an unclear target system.
- Until confirmation is received, only the minimum necessary read-only inspection is allowed.

## 2. Exact-system authorization and isolation

Before development or any mutating action, record and obtain explicit owner confirmation of:

- the exact target system;
- the exact repository, project, workflow, worker, channel, branch, environment, tenant/subscriber, and files or resources in scope;
- the exact allowed actions;
- every system and resource explicitly excluded from change.

Develop or mutate only the confirmed target and scope. Do not develop, modify, configure, deploy, activate, publish, test through mutation, or “prepare” changes in any other system. Dependencies and touchpoints may be inspected read-only when necessary, but must remain unchanged unless the owner separately authorizes them.

## 3. Mandatory cross-system touchpoint gate

If a request, discussion, architecture, configuration, or code has any touchpoint with one or more of these systems—**n8n, Lovable, LINE, or Cloudflare**—before development or any mutating action:

1. identify and verify the exact systems, projects, workflows, endpoints, webhooks, proxies/workers, credentials/secrets references, branches, environments, tenants/subscribers, and data paths involved;
2. trace upstream and downstream impact across all four systems, including shared n8n orchestration and other SuperChoice AI projects;
3. distinguish confirmed facts from unknowns and assumptions;
4. obtain explicit owner confirmation of the exact system to change and the allowed scope;
5. keep every unconfirmed system read-only and unchanged.

A touchpoint with one system does not authorize changes in the other three. Existing access, credentials, tools, code, workflow references, shared endpoints, or technical capability never count as authorization.

If identity, ownership, routing, tenant/subscriber boundary, environment, shared dependency, impact, or scope is unclear, the result is `NO-GO`: do not develop or mutate anything; ask the owner.

## 4. n8n prohibition: no test/manual artifacts

Unless the authorized owner explicitly requests the exact n8n artifact and action, do **not** create, duplicate, import, modify, run, activate, publish, or delete:

- test nodes or temporary/debug nodes;
- Manual Trigger nodes or other manual nodes;
- test workflows, manual workflows, temporary workflows, diagnostic workflows, shadow workflows, or cloned workflows;
- test branches or alternate execution paths inside a workflow;
- test data, mock payload paths, or helper artifacts that mutate n8n or connected systems.

Read-only inspection of existing n8n workflows is allowed only when it is necessary for the confirmed task. Testing must use the owner-confirmed real path and method; never invent a test node, manual node, manual workflow, or alternate test path. If the testing method is not explicitly confirmed, STOP and ask before testing.

## 5. Fail-closed enforcement

If target-system confirmation or cross-system verification is missing, ambiguous, contradictory, or incomplete:

- do not write code;
- do not edit repositories or external systems;
- do not create branches or pull requests;
- do not change workflows, nodes, webhooks, routes, callbacks, workers, environments, credentials, secrets, data, or deployments;
- do not take action in a different system as a workaround;
- report the ambiguity and wait for explicit owner confirmation.

This gate supplements all stricter repository governance. It never weakens PR, branch, production, security, RLS, testing, impact-review, or deployment rules.
<!-- SUPERCHOICE AI PLATFORM CROSS-SYSTEM SCOPE GATE — END -->


<!-- SUPERCHOICE AI IDENTITY NAMESPACE & REUSE-FIRST RULE — START -->
# SuperChoice AI Identity Namespace & Reuse-First Rule

This rule is mandatory for all human and AI development, investigation, troubleshooting, architecture, planning, and implementation work in this repository.

## 1. Never communicate an ID without its system namespace

SuperChoice AI spans multiple systems. Terms such as UUID, user ID, account ID, project ID, workflow ID, branch ID, tenant ID, LINE user ID, secret key, primary key, foreign key, unique key, token subject, and similar identifiers are ambiguous unless their owning system and storage location are stated.

Whenever an identifier is requested, referenced, compared, copied, mapped, debugged, or returned, always identify at least:
- the owning system/platform;
- the project/application/tenant where applicable;
- the database/service/storage location where applicable;
- the table/collection/object/field where known;
- the semantic meaning of the identifier.

Bad:
- "<UUID ของบัญชี [ชื่อ] ที่ล็อกอินอยู่>"
- "ใช้ user_id นี้"
- "เอา ID จาก profile"

Required:
- "<UUID ของบัญชี [ชื่อ] ที่ล็อกอินอยู่ในฐานข้อมูล Car4Cash / Lovable project>"
- "<LINE user ID จาก LINE Messaging webhook event.source.userId>"
- "<Car4Cash user UUID จาก public.profiles.id ใน Lovable Cloud database>"
- "<GitHub repository ID ของ superchoice-ai/tansub>"
- "<n8n workflow ID ของ workflow [ชื่อ] ใน SuperChoice AI n8n Cloud>"

If two systems use values that look similar or are both UUIDs, never imply they are interchangeable. State the mapping explicitly, for example:
LINE user ID -> Car4Cash/Lovable user UUID -> profile/role/branch authorization.

If the identifier source is not verified, say exactly which system/location still needs verification before development or data mutation.

## 2. Unique keys and identity mapping must be explicit

Before designing joins, mappings, authentication links, webhook identity resolution, authorization, deduplication, routing, or external integrations, explicitly identify:
- source-system key;
- destination-system key;
- uniqueness scope;
- cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:M);
- where the mapping is stored;
- which system is the source of truth.

Do not invent a new mapping table, key, UUID, or synchronization process until checking whether an existing key/mapping already exists in SuperChoice AI.

## 3. Reuse-first architecture is mandatory

When a development question touches or resembles capabilities already present in SuperChoice AI, inspect and reuse the existing platform before proposing new architecture.

Relevant touchpoints include, but are not limited to:
- LINE / messaging / chat tools;
- Lovable / application backend / database / auth;
- n8n / workflow / automation / orchestration;
- GitHub / version control / repository governance;
- Cloudflare / worker / proxy / network / security;
- MCP / tools / agents / AI routing;
- webhook / callback / API gateway;
- identity / role / branch / tenant authorization;
- notification / push / reply integrations.

Also apply the same principle to any new technology with an equivalent function, such as another chat tool, web tool, workflow/automation platform, version-control system, proxy, gateway, or security layer.

Before estimating or proposing development:
1. inventory what SuperChoice AI already has for the same capability;
2. verify current implementation and touchpoints in the relevant systems;
3. identify the smallest missing gap;
4. extend the existing path with the minimum necessary change;
5. only propose a new subsystem when reuse is demonstrably insufficient.

## 4. Do not over-design from an isolated project view

Never assume the current repository is a standalone system if the request touches SuperChoice AI platform capabilities.

Example:
If LINE already has webhook handling, X-Line-Signature validation through Cloudflare, LINE user mapping, Lovable authorization, MCP tools, AI routing, n8n orchestration, and LINE Messaging API support, do not propose rebuilding an end-to-end 1-way/2-way messaging platform from scratch. First trace the existing path and add only the missing glue, route, reply call, mapping, or authorization step.

Development estimates must be based on the verified missing gap, not on rebuilding components that already exist elsewhere in SuperChoice AI.

## 5. Cross-system confirmation still applies

This reuse-first rule does not override the existing cross-system scope gate.

If work may modify more than one system, identify the exact systems and confirm the intended development target before writing or changing code. Read-only inspection across related SuperChoice AI systems is allowed when necessary to understand existing reusable capability, but mutation must remain within the owner-confirmed scope.

<!-- SUPERCHOICE AI IDENTITY NAMESPACE & REUSE-FIRST RULE — END -->

<!-- BRANCH LIFECYCLE AND CROSS-REPOSITORY PORTING — BEGIN -->

# CRITICAL RULE — Branch Lifecycle, Generated-Artifact Ownership, and Cross-Repository Porting

This rule applies to **every action involving any branch**, including branch creation, checkout, synchronization, comparison, rebase, commit, push, pull request, merge, release, rollback, deletion, cherry-pick, file copy, and feature porting. It applies before, during, and after the action.

## 1. Same-repository branches

Before creating or changing a branch:

1. Verify the exact repository, source branch, target branch, and current commit SHA.
2. Create the branch from the intended verified baseline; do not assume the active branch or cached preview is current.
3. Inventory generated files, plugin-managed files, routes, manifests, schemas, auth/RLS rules, build configuration, lockfiles, and deployment configuration that the change could affect.
4. Record which system owns each generated artifact: repository source, build script, plugin, external platform, or manual maintenance.

Before merging branches in the same repository:

1. Treat the merge result as a new system state, not as proof that either branch remains valid.
2. Preserve the latest target-branch governance files and required generated/runtime artifacts.
3. Review deleted and renamed files explicitly; a clean textual merge is not proof of functional compatibility.
4. Run the target repository's required checks, including typecheck, build, lint/tests where configured, route inventory, manifest/OAuth parity when applicable, schema/Auth/RLS checks, and preview/runtime verification.
5. Do not approve or complete the merge if generated-artifact ownership is unclear, a plugin may overwrite repository-owned files, required artifacts disappear, a security gate can be bypassed, or preview and build results disagree.

## 2. Cross-repository branches and integrations

A branch in a target repository MUST be created from that target repository's own verified default branch. It MUST NOT be created from a source repository's commit or history.

Unless the owner explicitly authorizes the exact operation after a complete compatibility review:

- Do not merge a source repository or its branch into another repository's `main`.
- Do not cherry-pick an entire feature series or bulk commit set across repositories.
- Do not replace the target repository's package manifest, lockfile, build configuration, route tree, environment configuration, database migrations, auth/RLS policies, generated manifests, OAuth routes, deployment identifiers, or project identifiers with source-repository versions.
- Do not use `--allow-unrelated-histories` or any equivalent mechanism to combine unrelated repositories.

The default safe method is **porting**, not repository merging:

1. Create a feature branch from the target repository's own `main`.
2. Port only the approved concept and individually selected files or code.
3. Adapt the implementation to the target repository's architecture, dependencies, naming, routing, build system, database schema, Auth/RLS model, deployment model, and generated-artifact ownership.
4. Maintain a source-to-target mapping of what was ported, rewritten, omitted, and why.
5. Re-run all target-repository validation gates before any merge to the target `main`.

Example: a feature from `superchoice-ai/car4cash` must not be merged or bulk cherry-picked into `superchoice-ai/tansub/main`. Create a branch from `tansub/main`, then port and adapt only the approved feature pieces.

## 3. Generated files and plugin-managed paths

Before editing a generated or plugin-managed path, establish a single authoritative owner.

- If a plugin or generator owns the path, do not hand-edit it unless the owner explicitly approves changing that ownership model.
- If the repository owns the path, disable or remove automatic regeneration from the relevant build step safely, preserve every required runtime artifact in version control, and verify that no plugin can overwrite or delete it.
- Never allow a build-time generator to mutate tracked source unexpectedly.
- After any generator, plugin, dependency, or build-script change, audit deleted/renamed files and verify routes, OAuth endpoints, manifests, schemas, types, and security gates.
- A successful build alone is insufficient when required artifacts were deleted, generated from stale inputs, or made bypassable.

## 4. Required stop conditions

Stop before writing, pushing, or merging when any of the following is true:

- repository, source branch, target branch, or commit baseline is uncertain;
- source and target repositories have unrelated histories;
- dependency, runtime, schema, Auth/RLS, or deployment compatibility is unproven;
- plugin/generated-file ownership conflicts or is unclear;
- a required route, manifest, OAuth endpoint, security gate, migration, or configuration file is missing;
- build, preview, deployed runtime, or branch synchronization results disagree;
- the requested cross-repository action exceeds the owner's explicit authorization.

Report the blocker and request owner direction. Do not guess, silently broaden scope, or bypass the gate.

## 5. No AI-to-AI delegation by default

An AI assistant MUST NOT prompt, delegate work to, or conduct implementation conversations with another AI agent or AI-powered builder—including Lovable AI Agent—unless the owner explicitly authorizes the exact external AI system and scope for that action.

Tool availability, an open browser tab, repository connectivity, or prior authorization for a different action is not authorization for AI-to-AI communication. Direct deterministic use of GitHub repository tools is not AI-to-AI delegation.

## 6. Evidence required

For every branch integration or cross-repository port, retain concise evidence of:

- verified repository/branch/commit baselines;
- changed, deleted, renamed, generated, and plugin-owned files;
- dependency and configuration differences;
- validation commands and results;
- route/manifest/OAuth/schema/Auth/RLS/security checks where applicable;
- preview or runtime result;
- owner authorization for any exception.

If this evidence is incomplete, the change is not ready to merge.

<!-- DATABASE MIGRATION DEPENDENCY AND RPC 404 GATE — START -->
# CRITICAL RULE — Database Migration Dependency, Deployment Order, and RPC 404 Diagnosis

> [!CAUTION]
> This gate is mandatory whenever application code, UI, API, workflow, Edge Function, or integration depends on a database migration, table, column, view, trigger, function, RPC, grant, RLS policy, schema, or generated database type. A successful build, reachable page, or deployed frontend is not evidence that the target database is ready.

## 1. Build and maintain an explicit dependency manifest

Before implementation or release, identify for every changed consumer:

- the exact repository, branch, commit, application/project, and target environment;
- the exact database service/project/environment and migration target;
- each required migration filename and immutable commit/SHA;
- every required schema object, including exact schema-qualified table, column, view, trigger, function/RPC signature, grant, RLS policy, and generated type;
- the consumers that require each object and the minimum compatible version;
- deployment order, validation evidence, rollback/forward-fix plan, and owner authorization.

Do not group unrelated changes into vague labels such as “code group,” “backend update,” or “migration done.” Dependency evidence must be traceable per change set and per target environment.

## 2. Mandatory deployment order

Unless a confirmed compatibility plan explicitly proves another safe sequence, use this order:

1. verify repository/branch/commit and exact target database environment;
2. back up or define a safe rollback/forward-fix boundary;
3. apply required backward-compatible migrations to that target database;
4. verify migration history and query the required schema objects/RPC signatures directly;
5. verify grants, Auth/RLS, role/branch/tenant scope, and a minimal authenticated read-only RPC/API probe;
6. deploy or expose the dependent API/code/UI;
7. test separately in dependency order: Database → RPC/API → application code/UI → affected end-to-end path;
8. record evidence for every group before continuing to the next group.

Never deploy or enable code that calls a new RPC, column, table, function, view, trigger, policy, or signature before proving that the exact target database contains and permits it. Preview and Production are separate targets; applying a migration to one never proves it exists in the other.

## 3. Compatibility and rollback rule

Prefer expand-and-contract migrations when old and new code may coexist. A rollback plan must account for both code and database state. Do not assume reverting code reverses a migration, and do not destructively down-migrate production data unless separately reviewed and explicitly authorized. If atomic release is unavailable, keep the new consumer disabled or fail-closed until database readiness is proven.

## 4. Mandatory RPC/API 404 diagnosis order

When an RPC/API request returns HTTP 404, do not begin by guessing API keys, credentials, proxy behavior, or provider incidents. Capture evidence first and diagnose in this order:

1. Browser Console and Network: exact URL, method, status, response body/error code, request origin, and environment identity;
2. client configuration: exact API base URL/project reference and schema used by the running Preview/Production build;
3. target database: migration history and existence of the exact schema-qualified object/function plus complete RPC signature/overloads;
4. API exposure: schema exposure/cache refresh, grants, Auth/RLS, and role permissions;
5. proxy/gateway/routing behavior;
6. API key/token/credential validity only when the observed status/body or an authenticated control request supports that hypothesis;
7. official provider status and relevant logs when project-path evidence indicates an external incident.

Differentiate at minimum: route/object not found, RPC signature mismatch, schema cache miss, authorization/RLS denial, invalid credential, wrong project/environment, proxy rewrite, and provider outage. A first 404, 401, timeout, blank screen, or successful page reload is not root-cause proof.

## 5. Required release evidence and fail-closed conditions

Before merge, publish, deploy, or activation, record:

- migration applied successfully to the exact target database;
- direct existence/signature checks for every required object/RPC;
- authenticated permission/RLS probe with expected role/branch/tenant scope;
- separate test results for DB, RPC/API, code/UI, and affected end-to-end flows;
- preserved behavior/regression results for existing consumers;
- rollback/forward-fix readiness and remaining UNKNOWN items.

Result is `NO-GO` if the target environment is ambiguous, a required migration/object/signature is missing, migration state cannot be verified, Preview/Production bindings are unclear, tests were skipped or combined so the failing layer cannot be identified, or the dependent code would become reachable before its database prerequisites.

## Standing lesson

A Preview failure repeated because dependent code was exposed before `20260906180000_active_user_enforcement.sql` existed in the Preview database, causing the application to call a missing RPC. The first diagnosis focused on API-key possibilities instead of Console/Network evidence and target-DB migration state. Future work must prove dependency order and isolate DB → RPC/API → code/UI tests before release.
<!-- DATABASE MIGRATION DEPENDENCY AND RPC 404 GATE — END -->

<!-- FULL-STACK IMPACT, ORDER, AND VALIDATION GATE — BEGIN -->
# CRITICAL RULE — Full-Stack Impact, Dependency Order, and Mandatory Validation

> [!CAUTION]
> This gate applies before every development task or branch action, regardless of whether the request appears to affect only UI, wording, configuration, or one file. A visible feature is not complete until every required upstream and downstream dependency has been traced, implemented, ordered, and verified.

## 1. Mandatory full-system impact matrix

Before editing or creating a branch, record each dimension as **affected**, **verified unaffected**, or **unknown** with evidence:

- FE/UI, routes, state, responsive behavior, loading/error states, and generated client assets;
- BE/server functions, middleware, SSR, background processing, and shared libraries;
- database schema, existing data, constraints, indexes, triggers, functions, and views;
- migrations, ordering, idempotency, backward compatibility, target environment, rollback/forward-fix, and whether application is separately authorized;
- configuration, environment variables, build-time injection, feature flags, package/lock files, deployment bindings, and generated/plugin-owned files;
- API/RPC contracts, schemas, request headers, proxies/gateways, caches, and every caller/consumer;
- authentication, OAuth callbacks/redirects/session restoration, authorization, roles, branch/tenant scope, RLS policies, grants, and service-role boundaries;
- external integrations and workflows, including n8n, Lovable, LINE, Cloudflare, webhooks, secrets references, Preview, and Production.

An **unknown** in a required dependency is a stop condition. A clean textual diff or successful UI render is not proof that the system is compatible.

## 2. Complete vertical-slice and dependency trace

Trace each requested capability from entry point to final dependency and back. Do not copy only the visible component.

Standing example: a version-info icon requires the UI component, environment-variable consumer, exact variable name, build-version generator, Vite/config injection, timezone/version rule, and verification in generated client and SSR assets. Copying only the icon/component and leaving a fallback such as `000000v.01` is incomplete.

For every feature, maintain a source-to-target/dependency map listing what is copied, adapted, newly added, preserved, omitted, and why.

## 3. Mandatory implementation and release order

Define and follow the order before implementation. Unless compatibility evidence proves otherwise:

1. verify repository, latest `main`, branch baseline, environments, and system/project identities;
2. inventory dependencies, generated/config ownership, schema/Auth/RLS/API contracts, and existing behavior;
3. prepare backward-compatible database/config prerequisites;
4. apply migrations only to the explicitly authorized target environment and only when separately authorized;
5. verify DB objects → grants/RLS/Auth → API/RPC/proxy → BE/server;
6. implement or enable FE/UI consumers;
7. run static validation and builds;
8. verify Preview login/OAuth, protected routes, authenticated DB/API calls, error handling, and regressions;
9. merge only after evidence is complete; deploy/publish remains a separate explicit authorization.

Never expose dependent UI or code before its required migration, RPC, configuration, grant, or environment binding is proven ready.

## 4. Mandatory checks before merge

Run the repository-equivalent checks on the exact candidate commit and report commands, exit codes, failures, and evidence:

- dependency installation using the committed lockfile when needed;
- TypeScript typecheck: `npx tsc --noEmit` or the repository's stricter equivalent;
- production build: `npm run build`;
- development/Preview build when configured, such as `npm run build:dev`;
- configured lint, unit, integration, and regression tests;
- route, manifest, generated-artifact, and build-output inspection;
- migration static review plus schema/RPC/grant/RLS checks when database-related;
- Preview smoke test covering login/OAuth redirect, protected-route entry, authenticated DB/API access, and the changed user flow when applicable.

A successful `npm run build` does not replace Typecheck: transpilation may succeed while `tsc --noEmit` detects an invalid contract. A page rendering before login does not prove that protected routes, APIs, RPCs, RLS, or database bindings work.

If a mandatory check fails—even from a pre-existing error—record the baseline and exact failure, do not describe the candidate as fully passing, and do not merge unless the defect is fixed or the authorized owner explicitly accepts a documented exception under repository governance.

## 5. Required evidence and stop conditions

Before merge, retain:

- impact matrix and dependency/order plan;
- exact changed/deleted/renamed files and generated artifacts;
- database/migration/config/API/Auth/RLS/OAuth impact and target-environment evidence;
- commands and results for Typecheck, builds, tests, and Preview;
- preserved behavior, rollback/forward-fix, and remaining unknowns.

STOP before development, migration, merge, or release if scope, order, environment identity, dependency ownership, required checks, or rollback safety is unclear.

## Standing lessons

- Adding a version UI without its Vite build-time injection produced `Dev000000v.01` / `Prod000000v.01`.
- A build passed while `npx tsc --noEmit` still failed in `src/routes/__root.tsx`; Build and Typecheck are separate mandatory gates.
- Preview could render but fail after login when a required RPC/migration, API configuration, or authorization layer was missing or mismatched.

These are dependency and sequencing failures. Future work must prove the complete vertical slice and validate each layer in order.
